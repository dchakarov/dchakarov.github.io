<span class="dropcap">I</span>have been working on a word game recently and I wanted to have nice playful animations to make the UI more fun. I decided to improvise and I believe the result is good. In this post I will explain how you can create this effect and engage your users.

Every great animation starts with a single letter. Or something to that effect. Letâ€™s begin our journey with designing a letter tile.

```swift
struct SingleLetter: View {
    let letter: Character
    let backgroundColor: Color
    let letterColor: Color
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(String(letter))
            .foregroundColor(letterColor)
            .font(.title3)
            .fontWeight(.heavy)
            .frame(width: 44, height: 44)
            .background(backgroundColor)
    }
}


struct SingleLetter_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        SingleLetter(letter: "W",
                     backgroundColor: .brown,
                     letterColor: .white)
    }
}
```

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/first-letter.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 300px; border-width: 1px; border-color: #b20600; border-style: double;" alt="">

This is good enough for now. By using previews we can quickly test different colours and font sizes and land on a nice combination. Expanding the preview a little bit will help us see the letter in context. That way we can inform the next code we will write.

```swift
struct SingleLetter_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        HStack {
            SingleLetter(letter: "W",
                         backgroundColor: .brown,
                         letterColor: .white)
            .border(.orange)
            SingleLetter(letter: "O",
                         backgroundColor: .brown,
                         letterColor: .white)
            .border(.orange)
            SingleLetter(letter: "R",
                         backgroundColor: .brown,
                         letterColor: .white)
            .border(.orange)
            SingleLetter(letter: "D",
                         backgroundColor: .brown,
                         letterColor: .white)
            .border(.orange)
        }
    }
}
```

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/previews-ftw.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 300px; border-width: 1px; border-color: #b20600; border-style: double;" alt="">

My instinct tells me I should move the border definitions into the `SingleLetter` struct. I will hold off for now as I want to animate the borders later and I am not yet sure where I can do that better.

Next, let's create our `word` view, constructed by combining a bunch of letters. We already have the code in the preview above, so merely copying it to a new view produces a nice result.

```swift
struct SingleWord: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            SingleLetter(letter: "W",
                         backgroundColor: .brown,
                         letterColor: .white)
            .border(.orange)
            SingleLetter(letter: "O",
                         backgroundColor: .brown,
                         letterColor: .white)
            .border(.orange)
            SingleLetter(letter: "R",
                         backgroundColor: .brown,
                         letterColor: .white)
            .border(.orange)
            SingleLetter(letter: "D",
                         backgroundColor: .brown,
                         letterColor: .white)
            .border(.orange)
        }
    }
}

struct SingleWord_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        SingleWord()
    }
}
```

We already saw the result in the preview of the previous view, so let's keep going. Next, let's parametrise a little. We need to inject the word we want to show instead of hardcoding it.

```swift
struct SingleWord: View {
    let letters: [Character]

    init(word: String) {
        self.letters = Array(word)
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            ForEach(letters, id: \.self) { letter in
                SingleLetter(letter: letter,
                             backgroundColor: .brown,
                             letterColor: .white)
                .border(.orange)
            }
        }
    }
}

struct SingleWord_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        SingleWord(word: "WORD")
    }
}
```

Again, the preview is the same.

And we finally arrived at the interesting part. Let's shake these letters! We can start with rotating them left and right continuously. Some trial and error helps us determine the angle that will best serve our needs. Here you can see what happens when we try `.rotationEffect(Angle(degrees: -20))` and `.rotationEffect(Angle(degrees: +20))`

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/rotate-20.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: #b20600; border-style: double;" alt="">
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/rotate+20.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: #b20600; border-style: double;" alt="">

To animate the angle we need to make a few changes. We need a state var to hold a value that can be animated. We will use a boolean in this case. We also need to use the powerful `.animation` view modifier. There are many animation settings you can play with. For our purposes a simple `.linear` animation will suffice, with a duration of 1 second. We will set it to repeat forever and autoreverse as we don't want the letters to suddenly _twitch_. Let's see the code.

```swift
struct SingleWord: View {
    @State private var isAnimating = false
    private let letters: [Character]

    init(word: String) {
        self.letters = Array(word)
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            ForEach(letters, id: \.self) { letter in
                SingleLetter(letter: letter,
                             backgroundColor: .brown,
                             letterColor: .white)
                .border(.orange)
                .rotationEffect(Angle(degrees: isAnimating ? -20 : 20))
                .animation(.linear(duration: 1).repeatForever(autoreverses: true), value: isAnimating)
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            isAnimating = true
        }
    }
}
```

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/marching-letters.mov' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 300px; border-width: 1px; border-color: #b20600; border-style: double;" alt="">

They are moving! Job done? No. I don't know about you but to me that looks more like marching than dancing. It is a bit too perfect and uniform. One thing we can do it to alternate rotating letters - while the first rotates from -20 to 20 degrees, the second rotates from 20 to -20 degrees, and so on. In addition, we will introduce an explicit spacing for the `HStack` as we need the letters to be further apart and not overlap when they "dance".

```swift
    var body: some View {
        HStack(spacing: 20) {
            ForEach(letters.indices, id: \.self) { index in
                let letter = letters[index]
                SingleLetter(letter: letter,
                             backgroundColor: .brown,
                             letterColor: .white)
                .border(.orange)
                .rotationEffect(Angle(degrees: isAnimating ? angles(for: index).from : angles(for: index).to))
                .animation(.linear(duration: 1).repeatForever(autoreverses: true), value: isAnimating)
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            isAnimating = true
        }
    }
    
    private func angles(for index: Int) -> (from: Double, to: Double) {
        index.isMultiple(of: 2) ? (from: -20, to: 20) : (from: 20, to: -20)
    }
```

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/rotating-letters.mov' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 300px; border-width: 1px; border-color: #b20600; border-style: double;" alt="">

To make the movements even less _perfect_ we can introduce randomness. Instead of returning `-20` or `20`, the `angles` method can return something like `Double.random(in: 18...22)`, for example.

So far we managed to produce _rotating letters_. Our target is _dancing letters_ so let's keep going. The other two attributes we can animate are `scale` and `border width`. Changing the scale of the letters will introduce a pulsating effect, which combined with a border thickness will have the desired effect. We want all these animations to happen in unison, that's why we are going to be using the same `isAnimating` variable to control all of them. Let's start with `scale`. We don't want the letters to get way too big or way too tiny, so the scale factor shouldn't change more than 10-20%. You can play with it and see what values work for you. For my needs, 0.85 - 1.15 seems to work best. Once again, feel free to add randomness for even better results.

```swift
    var body: some View {
        HStack(spacing: 20) {
            ForEach(letters.indices, id: \.self) { index in
                let letter = letters[index]
                SingleLetter(letter: letter,
                             backgroundColor: .brown,
                             letterColor: .white)
                .border(.orange)
                .rotationEffect(Angle(degrees: isAnimating ? angles(for: index).from : angles(for: index).to))
                .scaleEffect(isAnimating ? scale(for: index).from : scale(for: index).to)
                .animation(.linear(duration: 1).repeatForever(autoreverses: true), value: isAnimating)
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            isAnimating = true
        }
    }
    
    private func angles(for index: Int) -> (from: Double, to: Double) {
        index.isMultiple(of: 2) ? (from: -20, to: 20) : (from: 20, to: -20)
    }
    
    private func scale(for index: Int) -> (from: Double, to: Double) {
        index.isMultiple(of: 2) ? (from: 0.85, to: 1.15) : (from: 1.15, to: 0.85)
    }
```

We are almost there. Let's now animate our borders too. And introduce that randomness I keep mentioning. Also, let's change the preview background and see how our letters perform on a darker stage.

```swift
struct SingleWord: View {
    @State private var isAnimating = false
    private let letters: [Character]

    init(word: String) {
        self.letters = Array(word)
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack(spacing: 20) {
            ForEach(letters.indices, id: \.self) { index in
                let letter = letters[index]
                SingleLetter(letter: letter,
                             backgroundColor: .brown,
                             letterColor: .white)
                .border(.orange, width: isAnimating ? 5 : 0)
                .rotationEffect(Angle(degrees: isAnimating ? angles(for: index).from : angles(for: index).to))
                .scaleEffect(isAnimating ? scale(for: index).from : scale(for: index).to)
                .animation(.linear(duration: 1).repeatForever(autoreverses: true), value: isAnimating)
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            isAnimating = true
        }
    }
    
    private func angles(for index: Int) -> (from: Double, to: Double) {
        let firstAngle = Double.random(in: -22 ... -18)
        let secondAngle = Double.random(in: 18 ... 22)
        return index.isMultiple(of: 2) ? (from: firstAngle, to: secondAngle) : (from: secondAngle, to: firstAngle)
    }
    
    private func scale(for index: Int) -> (from: Double, to: Double) {
        let firstScale = Double.random(in: 0.85 ... 0.9)
        let secondScale = Double.random(in: 1.1 ... 1.15)
        return index.isMultiple(of: 2) ? (from: firstScale, to: secondScale) : (from: secondScale, to: firstScale)
    }
}

struct SingleWord_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ZStack {
            Color.black.opacity(0.8).ignoresSafeArea()
            SingleWord(word: "PLAY")
        }
    }
}
```

In summary, we created a cool dancing effect that can delight our users. We didn't even have to build our app, we saw all the action in the live previews. Where to go from here? You can try adding more animations to your views. Another easily animatable property is the offset. I didn't include it here as it would have been a bit too much animating all at once. Another thing you can do is extract the rest of the hardcoded values, such as the frame size, the spacing, and the border width, and play with them. Let me know what you manage to achieve.
