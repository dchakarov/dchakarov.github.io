description: How to install Ruby on my mac.

<span class="dropcap">E</span>very year when the new macOS is out I do the same thing. I format my second SSD, install the new OS there, boot from it, and start installing the apps I need one by one. I have the luxury of having two SSD drives which makes the whole exercise very easy. Whenever I feel like I am missing something - be that a config file for an app, or some key mappings I can't quite reproduce - I reboot into the previous OS and get what I need.

After a few weeks or months I disconnect the now old SSD and use the iMac for another couple of months. If all goes well, I know I can safely wipe the SSD and get it ready for next year.

Having done that just a month ago (the first stage), I am now in the perfect spot to create a nice list of the apps I actually use, so when my shiny new M1 MacBook Air arrives, I can be prepared[^1]. Here we go.

*Telegram* - my favourite messaging app. Gotta love those stickers!

*Spark* - my email client of choice.

*Xcode + Darcula + Source Code Pro* - I have some code to write.
  
*WhatsApp* - some people are not on Telegram. Sigh.

*iTerm2 + Fish + Oh My Fish + Homebrew* - gotta pimp my terminal.

*SourceTree* - yes, I know git. But I like clicking on things.

*Slack* - I have to. It's 2020.

*Tor* - for the privacy.

*ForkLift* - good for babysitting my servers.

*Ulysses* - best app for writing fiction.

*Downie* - gotta save those tubes.

*Gemini* - great for getting rid of low quality photos you're too lazy to search for manually.

*Skype* - some people are not even on WhatsApp. Double sigh.

*Visual Studio Code* - best app for writing non-fiction.

*OneNote* - better notes than Notes.

*IINA* - best video player in town.

*Dropbox* - my files are there.

*Instapaper* - for saving articles I never read.

In preparing the list I was tempted to sort it by priority, or importance. That's not an easy task. How do you define priority? Is it more important to have a good app to code, or a good app to watch a movie? Moreover, I am now going to use this list on two macs with somewhat different usage patterns. In short, consider the list above _not sorted_. Thank you.
