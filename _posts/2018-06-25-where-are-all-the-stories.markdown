<span class="dropcap">I</span>n trying to refresh my online presence, I went through all the things _me_ online and decided to get some stats out. My initial idea was to create a sort of a basic homepage or a single screen app representing me. After some experimenting and testing (meaning that I actually created the app and the homepage and showed it to friends who didn't like it), I decided to take a more streamlined approach to my home page. Mostly because my home page shouldn't be just a glorified CV. In fact, it shouldn't be a CV at all. So I scraped the whole thing and started over, culminating at the current state of it (for now).

However, I still have the stats handy. Let's have a look, shall we?

**Written**

* 18 short stories
* 120+ tv show reviews
* 50+ articles
* a few shopping lists

**Created**

* 11 iOS apps
* 20+ web sites
* 2 kids

**Worked as**

* iOS Engineer
* Team Lead
* Construction worker
* Web Developer
* UX Designer
* Backend Developer
* Customer Support Representative
* Co-founder

**Languages**

* Swift
* Objective C
* Bulgarian
* PHP
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Python
* Perl

As you can see, I was trying to be funny, adding a quirky skill in each category. I could spend some time discussing them, but I don't think they are that interesting. What I want to focus on instead is the *Written* category. Unlike the other three, where you can see skills and achievements from my CV, the stories and tv show reviews I had written are not that easy to find. My plan going forward is to republish most of the short stories and articles (not the reviews - they are not that relevant anymore) here, on my blog. I will publish them backdated, so they will (hopefully) appear before this post. And most of them would be in Bulgarian which, in turn, would prove my claim that I speak it.

Without further ado, I present to you the first such story - [Чудото в 4 сутринта – фрагменти](/blog/4am-miracle-fragments/)
