<span class="dropcap">I</span>t was 6 am. She was already up, doing her favourite thing before breakfast – trying to crash her browser. She positioned her mouse pointer over the “close downloads” button in the bottom right corner of the browser window, clicked the right mouse button and tried to drag the button simultaneously. It didn’t work. She released the button and switched to her spreadsheet app, filled some data into a column and switched back. Would it work if she tries with both buttons at the same time? Let’s see...

She kept on clicking and dragging for about 20 minutes until she got a "send a report" screen.

"Yes! Nailed you!" – she screamed, pointing at the screen.

Her boyfriend came into the room. He was still in his pyjamas and carrying a coffee pot. He looked at the screen and said:

"You’re the only person I know who feels joy when this happens."

"How could you not feel joy," she replied, "I won!"

"You have a strange definition of winning," he said and he filled her coffee mug – the one with `Pics or it didn’t happen` written with white letters on blue background. "Do you want me to make you something to eat?"

"No, it's my turn to make breakfast. Just give me a second to send this baby,"  she smiled as she copied and pasted some lines from the spreadsheet to the report window.
