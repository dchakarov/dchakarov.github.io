description: I have an interesting relationship with writing. And with e-bikes.

<span class="dropcap">I</span>have an interesting relationship with writing. I value it way too much. I feel like everything I write needs to be _used_ somehow or otherwise it’s for nothing. People say the way to develop your writing it to read more and… write. Keep writing. Don’t stop. Don’t even bother editing, at least not in the beginning.

_I arrived at the station around 7 pm. I went to the nearby shop to get some juice and headed home. I was tired and needed to pee. I checked the Lime app for nearby bikes. I did it almost impulsively. There was a bike a street over._

I am not the same with anything else, I don’t think. When I write code, I’m not that attached to it. I don’t mind other people changing it. I don’t care if it’s gonna be used or thrown away. Same with money. One could say, I’m a bit careless with money. I spend impulsively and don’t keep close tabs on what I have in my bank account. I am taking full advantage of the UK banking system and all the important money-related stuff is automated.

_The bike was parked in the middle of the street. It was a small street, behind a residential building. It was mostly used for supplying the aforementioned shop and to access the nearby garages. I approached the bike and swiped on the app to unlock it. I heard the usual chime as the bike unlocked and I put my phone back in my pocket. I got on the bike and tried to take off. The bike wouldn’t move. The rear wheel was clearly blocked and wouldn’t give an inch. I pushed down the rage bubbling to the surface. The same exact thing had happened to me the day before._

Part of the problem is that in my mind the words are ephemeral. The minute I have a good idea - good, in my mind - I need to immediately write it down or else I’ll forget it forever. If I don’t have a place to write it, I just ignore it. I accept the fact that it’s gone forever. That’s why, in my head, it’s very important how I write stuff. Where I write stuff. And that leads us to the app question. What do you use to write?

_Okay, what should I do? I know, I just need to end my current ride and restart it and the bike might unlock. Worst case, it will fail again and I will have to end the ride again and I will end up losing a few pennies. No big deal. I tap on “end ride” and I get a friendly message saying the zone I am currently in is a non-parking zone and if I want to end my ride I need to first reach the nearest bike parking. I stare at the phone while my brain slowly assimilates the information._

A couple of years ago, I found an app that gamifies the daily writing exercise. It was called something like “700 words” or similar. The idea was to write at least 700 (or was it 400?) words every day using their text field. For each day you get a star or a heart or something. And you get streaks, bragging rights, etc. It was a nice concept. The app was a tad buggy. I used it for a month and I was proud of myself. Then I got fed up and stopped.

_There was no way to end the ride. The bike was too heavy to carry for who knows how many meters. Not to mention, I was not the one that parked in a no-parking zone in the first place. The timer was ticking though. From Lime’s point of view I was enjoying my ride and they were happily adding to my bill. I had to find a way to end the stupid ride and inform them of the issue. I tapped on the help icon in the app. There was no phone number. There was a chat that wasn’t very useful as it was all automated with those stupid pregenerated responses. The time was ticking._

My first thought tonight, after I decided to spend some time writing, was, of course, how. Not what - that’s easy - but how. What app should I use. My mind started wandering. I remembered the 700 (or so) words app. Maybe I should write an app like that? Maybe I should start tonight, instead of, you know, _actually writing_. And whilst we are on the topic of writing an app, maybe I can finish off some of the side projects instead?

_I submitted a form for a problem with a ride and started walking home. I had lost enough time already. A few paces later I also decided to try to log a ticket for them. I vaguely remember seeing that option somewhere during my panicked browsing through the app. I kept walking and typing in the ticket. I really leaned on the unfairness and frustration I was feeling. I felt… odd. it wasn’t a big deal, in the grand scheme of things. At worst, I would have to pay an unreasonable amount for something I haven’t used, but I wasn’t expecting that to be more than, say, twenty quid. Fifty or so meters later I reached the part on the form where I needed to give the bike number. That really annoyed me. Not the actual request but the whole form. A wise man once said that the computer should not ask you for something it could get itself. This form was asking me for *everything*! Name, email, phone number, country, bike id. It should know all of that already!_

How hard is to write an app that counts words? I can even use the new Swift Data API Apple just introduced. Maybe the app will become so good I can start selling it to people. I can even try to connect it to Notes and use that as a storage.

_I went back to the bike and noted down the bike id. The ride was still ongoing. I tried not to think about it. I looked around. I saw a car driving towards the nearest garage. In my mind I started preparing for what to say if the driver asked me why did I stop the bike in the middle of the street. He didn’t. I, once again, started walking home. I submitted the form. A few minutes later I received a notification informing me that my ride would be automatically ended due to inactivity. Then another message telling me that I owe a fine for parking incorrectly. I ignored these and continued walking. There was nothing I could do at this point._

It was hard to resist the urge to start coding instead. Or watch a tv show. Or play a game. Or literally anything else. I opened Notes and created a blank note. I wrote “I have an interesting relationship with writing.”

_An hour later I received an email from Lime. They said they share my frustration and informed me that my problem with ending the ride was caused by my incorrect parking. I took a deep breath. I tapped Reply. I started with “Let me try to explain one more time.”_
_A few minutes later I received another email apologising and offering me 50% off my next ride. Before I replied, I checked to see if they annulled the charges (for the shitty non-ride and the parking fee). I was glad to see £0 charge. I took a deep breath. “Thank you for...”_
