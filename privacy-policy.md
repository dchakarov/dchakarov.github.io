**Effective Date:** November 11, 2025  
**Last Updated:** November 30, 2025

## Overview

MZ: Maze Adventures ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our iOS game.

## Information We Collect

**We collect minimal, anonymized analytics data only.**

The App collects:
- **Anonymized usage events** (via Aptabase)
  - Game start, level completion, feature usage
  - Device type and OS version (technical info only)
  - **No personal identifiers, user IDs, or tracking cookies**
  - **100% anonymized** — individual events cannot be linked back to you

**Optional:**
- **Game Center integration** (Apple-managed, optional)
  - Only enabled if you sign in to Game Center
  - Leaderboards and achievements managed by Apple
  - Apple controls your Game Center data, not us

## What We Do NOT Collect

We do NOT:
- Collect names, emails, location, or personal data
- Track individual user behavior or sessions
- Share data with third parties or advertisers
- Use cookies or persistent identifiers
- Require account creation or login
- Sell or monetize your data

## Data Storage

All game progress, settings, and unlocked content are stored **locally on your device** using Apple's standard iOS storage (UserDefaults, local files). This data never leaves your device.

Analytics events are sent to Aptabase's servers for aggregated analysis only (to help us improve the game). These events are completely anonymized.

## Third-Party Services

**Aptabase Analytics:**
- Privacy-focused, anonymized analytics
- No personal data collection
- Data is GDPR compliant
- Learn more: [aptabase.com](https://aptabase.com)

**Apple Game Center:**
- Optional, Apple-managed service
- Subject to Apple's privacy policy

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since we collect only anonymized analytics and do not require account creation, the App is safe for users of all ages.

## Privacy Choices

You have full control:
- All data is stored locally on your device
- You can optionally disable Game Center in iOS Settings
- We do not provide an opt-out for anonymized analytics (they cannot be linked to you anyway)

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
